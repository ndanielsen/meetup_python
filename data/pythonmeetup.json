Try to answer to 2 easy questions to avoid misunderstandings: - why women? is because you hate men? - No, although men are weirds (kidding ... some of my best friends are men). It seems I am weird because I don't find women in this particular field of developing bioinformatics tools (see this, for instance: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/chapmanb\/bcbio-nextgen#contributors\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/github.com\/chapmanb\/bcbio-nextgen#contributors<\/a>. Only a few out of 23 contributors. And this is one of the most collaborative tools I know) - and ... why? maybe women don't want this ... - well, I want to know if that is true, or whether there is another cultural reason behind that. I can not find any reason why women wouldn't be interested in developing bioinformatics tools. If there is, maybe I find what it is and I can publish a Nature paper (kidding again ...) Another experience was the last hackathons of codeFest (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.open-bio.org\/wiki\/Codefest_2014\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.open-bio.org\/wiki\/Codefest_2014<\/a>), where only there were two women out of 60 people...

So, please, if you are interested in learn <b>how to develop<\/b> tools in Bioinformatics, <b>or you already do<\/b>, but feel alone (kidding again) ... just join the meetup and help to increase woman population in this field.

The event's founders needed an excuse to find time to work on the ideas they always spoke about when they met at other tech events, but never found the time; they also thought this was probably a problem other developers faced, and that the added peer pressure of sharing their creations from conception would help them actually produce their projects. As a result London Python Project Nights was born. We welcome anyone who has a project idea they would like to work on, or looking for a project to contribute to. We have had people come to start a new project, people working on their existing project, people joining those of other attendees, even people coming to work alone on large well-known open source products. We do not enforce a minimum level of coding ability, but we do expect everyone to contribute on some level, and have a code of conduct we expect attendees to adhere to (<a href=\"http:\/\/london-python-project-nights.github.io\/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/london-python-project-nights.github.io\/code-of-con...<\/a>). This is intended to make the event as inclusive as possible, and suggestions for ways we can improve are welcome. TL;TR In summary we're all about code, everyone is welcome, bring your own food and drink, work on whatever you want, as long as you're willing to talk people through what you've done at the end.

I find computing and software fun, intriguing, intuitive, educational beyond its surface technology and fulfilling, and I'd like many more to experience computer science and software development in that way whether they are enthusiasts or professionals.<\/p>\n<p>With this meetup, I would like to hold monthly meetups with short and long presentations by group members; study different Python practices, techniques, libraries, frameworks and applications; perhaps, create an open source application as part of the group's activities; and, perhaps, seek out financial sponsors to help attract speakers from outside of the area. I plan to offer introductory and advanced workshops on Python and Python-based applications, and to connect the group with book publishers so that we can offer door prizes to meeting attendees.<\/p>\n<p>I'd enjoy hearing any ideas you may have to offer.

Born from the attendees of Code Retreat Boulder 2011, we meet bimonthly to hone our skills working on interesting problems.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Code Retreat format was developed by Corey Haines and others. The essence of the format is that people pair-program on a problem for 45 minutes then throw away their code, take a short break, switch partners and repeat the process. Classically, these are full-day events including 6 programming sessions, a long lunch, and beer afterwards. In this group, we will meet in the evening and probably do just two sessions.<\/p>\r\n<p>The primal Code Retreat problem is Conway's Game of Life - it's an interesting problem in that it admits a wide variety of solutions and is simple enough that one can usually almost (but not quite) write a complete implementation in 45 minutes. While we're starting off this group working on Life (at least for the first meetup) my hope is that we expand the scope to work on other problems of similar size, complexity, and that support a similar variety of approaches to their solution. Some possibilities include small parsers, interpreters, Project Euler problems, and other such challenges.<\/p>\r\n<p>The official Code Retreat site can be found at http:\/\/coderetreat.com for more information.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","845":"This group is for enthusiasts of lisp and lisp related programming.

The model for this group derived from our experience during \n<a href=\"http:\/\/hackership.org\">Hackership<\/a>. We were inspired by all the things that we learned and the new perspectives we gained. But we also knew that we wouldn't have the same environment at home, and we thought \"Ugh, back to learning in isolation!\" Coworking spaces and user groups don't really make the difference for us. So in talking about this, we found that we felt the same way, and came up with the idea of meeting up for continuous learning in a friendly group. Here's the idea: - Meet every 2 weeks for 1 whole day. - We meet in a place where we can sit together. - We start with a coworking space. In the morning, we talk briefly about what we want to learn, so that small groups can form. - We spend the day with self directed learning. We help each other in case we get stuck. - Over coffee breaks and lunch there is opportunity to chat. - In the evening we reserve 20 minutes for presentations, aka lightning talks. Anybody can talk about what the person thinks might be interesting to the others (this is different from Hackership). The aim is to create a friendly group with diverse skills and skill levels.","1088":"<p>Here's an idea.
